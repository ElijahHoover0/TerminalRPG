# TerminalRPG
My terminal window RPG personal project
The goal is to have an RPG to play in the terminal window. This will test my abilities to write code in C using concepts like:
Reading formatted input from a file, pointers, referencing and dereferencing, linked lists, memory allocation, and sorting algorithms.
The above concepts may not be all that are demonstrated in the program.
Features to implement: An inventory system, items to populate the inventory, different algorithms to sort the inventory, input file reading to generate a cast of monsters to spawn in the world, a system to randomly spawn enemies on the map, a system to read an input file of map data, a level system for the player, a combat system
